		<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p id="one">Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.
      On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>,
      and all the other scientific journals her work
      had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>.
      It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she
      spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
		<p id="two">She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an
      <span id="oscar">Oscar Wilde</span> quote proclaiming that
      <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.
      Although many considered her pioneering work,
      unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,
      to be an outstanding achievement,
      Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
