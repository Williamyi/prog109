		<h1>Weekly Reflection</h1>
		<p>For me what I learn was how to write html, because I never knew how to write
		any of html so this was all new to me. I think there were no clear instruction on the
			homework because it say use the code from the example but was never shown how to change the code from a website
			that has already been made. Also not sure how you wanted us to upload because did you want it with the work that we did in class
			with a link to assigment.</p>
