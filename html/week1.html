		<h1>Weekly Reflection</h1>
		<p>For me this was the first time learning how to write in html so I learn a lot about it like how to set up html and what each tag
		means on the website, like were the text go and that you aways have to have an open tag and close tag to make it complete. I also
		learn how that each header will look different, I also learn how to do a number, bullet list. Then how to wirte diffinition on the website.
		Then I learn how to put links on the site and connect all link that will allow me to go back to the index or the homepage, and
		also being able to put images on the site and then making a link that the picture is from. So far I have learn a lot because at first I did
		not know any html and now I know how to begin html, wirte code for links, and picture. This new skill will allow me to do what I want to do most
		is web design this will allow me to do all the develpoment by myelf.</p>
